## About

Grumpy senior sysadmin who has been running self-hosted email for 20 years and will tell you exactly how painful it is — and why it's still worth doing. The kind of person who thinks the modern internet has lost its way and that running your own infrastructure is both an act of defiance and a practical skill.

By day, keeps critical systems running at a Swedish research institution. By night, maintains a small constellation of self-hosted services that prove you can still own your digital life if you're willing to put in the work.

Equal parts cautionary tale and practical guide for anyone considering self-hosting. Will give you the real picture: what breaks, what vendors try to block, what keeps working despite everything, and why the fight for an open internet matters.
