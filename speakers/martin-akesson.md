## About

Senior researcher at FOI (Totalförsvarets forskningsinstitut), the Swedish Defence Research Agency, working on the intersection of open source software and defense applications. Navigating the surprising overlap between military requirements and open source values: transparency, auditability, avoiding vendor lock-in.

Challenging assumptions that defense software must be proprietary. Military systems need software that can be audited, that doesn't depend on foreign vendors who might not be allies tomorrow, and that benefits from broad expert review. Open source meets these requirements better than many realize.

Working to build bridges between the traditionally closed defense world and the open source community. Helping defense understand open source, and helping open source understand how defense contribution can work.
