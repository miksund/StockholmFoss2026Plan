## About

Developer advocate and Neovim enthusiast who believes the terminal is the most powerful development environment when configured thoughtfully. Creating content and giving talks about terminal-first development workflows: Neovim, tmux, and the ecosystem of CLI tools that make modern development fast and enjoyable.

Not a purist who thinks everyone must use vim — more interested in showing what's possible and letting developers make informed choices. Believes good tooling should be fast, composable, and not require a subscription.

Contributor to Neovim and the broader ecosystem of plugins and tools. Creating educational content to lower the barrier to entry for developers curious about terminal workflows.
