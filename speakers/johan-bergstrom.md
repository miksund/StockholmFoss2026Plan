## About

Leading the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) at H&M Group, one of the world's largest fashion retailers. Building the organizational capability to use, contribute to, and release open source software responsibly and strategically.

Navigating the unique challenges of open source in a non-tech company: explaining value to executives who don't speak developer, building processes that work for both legal and engineering, and creating a culture where contribution is normal rather than exceptional.

Believes every large organization should have an OSPO, but also realistic about what it takes to build one from scratch. Happy to share both successes and ongoing challenges.
