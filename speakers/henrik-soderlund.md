## About

Independent consultant specializing in digital identity systems, with deep expertise in Nordic eID solutions (BankID, Freja, NemID/MitID) and their interoperability challenges. Working at the intersection of technology, policy, and user experience to make digital identity work better.

Frustrated by how digital identity in the Nordics is simultaneously advanced and fragmented. Swedish BankID doesn't work in Norway. Finnish systems differ from Danish ones. Working toward a future where Nordic digital identity is truly interoperable, built on open standards.

Advocates for identity systems that respect privacy, work across borders, and don't lock users into specific vendors. Believes the European Digital Identity initiative could be transformative if implemented well (and disastrous if implemented poorly).
