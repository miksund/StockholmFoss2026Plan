## About

Frontend developer who recently switched from macOS to Fedora after 10 years in the Apple ecosystem. Documenting the transition honestly: what works better, what's worse, and what's just different.

Not a Linux evangelist — a pragmatic developer sharing real experiences about daily-driving Linux for professional web development. The switch was motivated by Apple's increasing lock-in, not ideology.

Blog series about the transition has resonated with others considering the same move.
