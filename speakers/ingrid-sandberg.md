## About

Technical writer advocating for Swedish translations of open source documentation and READMEs. Believes language accessibility matters: not everyone is comfortable reading English technical docs, and Swedish translations can lower the barrier to entry.

Coordinates volunteer translation efforts for several open source projects, focusing on beginner-friendly projects where Swedish docs help most. Also advocates for better internationalization practices in documentation tooling.

The talk argues that README translation isn't just nice-to-have — it's an accessibility feature that makes open source more inclusive for non-English speakers.
