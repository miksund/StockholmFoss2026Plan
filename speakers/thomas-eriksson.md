## About

Member of the Apache Software Foundation with 20+ years of open source contribution. Deep experience with open source governance models, having participated in projects ranging from one-person efforts to massive foundation-backed initiatives.

Perspective shaped by seeing what works and what fails in open source governance over two decades. Believes governance matters more as projects grow — the decisions you make early about how to make decisions will shape everything that follows.

Interested in sharing hard-won lessons about governance: when to formalize, how to handle conflicts, what foundations can and can't do for you, and the trade-offs between different organizational models.
