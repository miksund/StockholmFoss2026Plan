## About

Lead organizer of StockholmFoss, bringing years of experience organizing tech meetups and events in Stockholm. Founded the conference to fill the gap for a Swedish FOSS event that combines the community spirit of FOSDEM with relevance to the Nordic tech scene.

By day, a developer at a Stockholm company; by night (and many weekends), building the Swedish open source community through events. Believes conferences are about creating spaces for connection, not just content consumption.

Experienced in the thankless but essential work of conference organizing: venue logistics, sponsor relations, volunteer coordination, and making sure everything runs smoothly so attendees can focus on learning and connecting.
