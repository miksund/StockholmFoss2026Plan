## About

Backend developer who firmly believes that programming should be fun. Creator of Blåhaj-as-a-Service (BaaS), a completely unnecessary but technically interesting API for generating Blåhaj (IKEA shark) images, statistics, and facts.

Advocates for ridiculous side projects as a way to learn new technologies without the pressure of "real" work. BaaS taught more about API design, caching, rate limiting, and deployment than any serious project.

Regular at Gothenburg tech meetups, often presenting the latest absurd project.
