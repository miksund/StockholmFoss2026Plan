## About

Python core contributor focused on the type system and static analysis tooling. Believes Python's gradual typing story is one of the most important developments in the language's recent history and works to make it more practical and accessible.

Senior engineer by day at a Swedish fintech, using typed Python extensively in production. Contributor to Python core, mypy, and Pydantic ecosystem by night. Bridges the gap between the theoretical type system work and practical application in real codebases.

Passionate about developer experience and helping teams adopt typing incrementally. Not a typing purist — pragmatic about where types add value and where they don't.
