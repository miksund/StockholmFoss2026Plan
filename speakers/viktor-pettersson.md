## About

Site Reliability Engineering lead focused on observability and building vendor-neutral monitoring stacks. Passionate about OpenTelemetry and the promise of truly portable telemetry data — metrics, traces, and logs that aren't locked into any particular vendor's platform.

Career has spanned multiple Swedish tech companies, witnessing the same observability challenges everywhere: vendor lock-in, alert fatigue, context-switching between tools, and the gap between what developers need and what platform teams provide.

Now focused on building observability platforms that give teams the insights they need while maintaining flexibility and avoiding proprietary traps. Strong advocate for open standards and the OpenTelemetry project.
