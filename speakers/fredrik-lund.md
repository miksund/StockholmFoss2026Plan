## About

Platform engineer at Telia Company building and maintaining Kubernetes infrastructure at scale for one of Europe's largest telecommunications operators. Focused on making cloud native technologies work reliably in enterprise environments where downtime isn't an option.

Advocate for GitOps practices and the "boring technology" approach — using well-understood, proven tools rather than chasing the latest trends. Believes the best platform engineering is invisible: developers shouldn't need to think about infrastructure.

Active in the Swedish cloud native community, sharing practical experiences from operating Kubernetes in production with real constraints: compliance requirements, legacy system integration, and the organizational challenges of platform adoption.
