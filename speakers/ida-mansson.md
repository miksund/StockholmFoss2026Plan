## About

Software developer and Mozilla contributor working on Firefox from the unlikely location of Karlskrona, a small city in southern Sweden. Started contributing to Firefox as a hobby while working as a developer at a local company, eventually becoming a recognized contributor to the browser.

Passionate about browser diversity and the open web. Believes the web needs healthy competition and that Firefox's survival matters for internet freedom. Contributing from a Nordic timezone means different working hours than most Mozilla contributors, which brings both challenges and opportunities.

Focused on making the Firefox contribution experience accessible to others. Remembers how daunting the codebase seemed initially and works to help newcomers find their path.
