## About

IT coordinator at the Sami Parliament of Sweden (Sámediggi), working to digitize and preserve Sami languages through open source technology. Building keyboard layouts, spell checkers, language learning tools, and other digital resources for Northern Sami and other Sami languages.

Member of the Sami community who understands that language preservation in the digital age requires digital tools. If our languages don't exist in computers and phones, they become harder to use in daily life, especially for younger generations who live digitally.

Collaborating with Sami communities across Norway, Sweden, and Finland to build shared language technology resources. Open source is natural for this work: no corporation will build tools for languages with 20,000 speakers, so communities must build together.
