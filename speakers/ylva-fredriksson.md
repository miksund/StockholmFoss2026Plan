## About

Senior researcher at AI Sweden leading work on Swedish language technology and natural language processing. Key contributor to GPT-SW3, the first truly capable Swedish language model, and ongoing efforts to build open Swedish AI resources.

Passionate about ensuring Swedish and other Nordic languages have adequate AI support. Believes that if we don't build Swedish language technology ourselves, we'll be permanently dependent on English-centric AI systems that don't understand our linguistic nuances, dialects, and cultural context.

Focus on open resources: open datasets, open models, open evaluation benchmarks. The goal is enabling the entire Swedish research community and industry to build on shared foundations.
