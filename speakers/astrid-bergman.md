## About

Software engineer at GitHub working on Git core development, focusing on performance optimizations for large-scale repositories. One of the active contributors to Git itself, with particular focus on the partial clone feature, sparse checkout, and the scalar tool that makes Git work better with massive monorepos.

Came to Git development through the practical experience of dealing with enormous codebases at Swedish companies. Now combines that practical experience with deep knowledge of Git's internals to make version control work better for everyone.

Passionate about developer experience and the tools that make software development possible. Believes Git, despite being 20 years old, still has significant room for improvement and evolution.
