## About

Executive Director of Open Knowledge Sweden, working to make government data accessible, usable, and valuable for everyone. Bridging the gap between policy aspirations about open data and the messy reality of PDFs, broken links, and inconsistent formats.

Believes open data is essential infrastructure for democracy, journalism, research, and innovation. Frustrated by how often "open data" means a PDF on a website that nobody can use. Working to raise the bar for what open data actually means.

Practical focus on helping municipalities and agencies actually publish useful data, not just check compliance boxes. Combining policy advocacy with hands-on technical work to make open data real.
