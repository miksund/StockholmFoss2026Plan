## About

Software engineer exploring the edges of what's possible with WebAssembly — not just in browsers, but as a universal runtime for serverless functions, plugins, and edge computing. Contributor to the Fermyon ecosystem and advocate for Wasm as the next evolution in portable, sandboxed code execution.

Fascinated by the idea of "compile once, run anywhere" finally becoming real after decades of promises. Working to make WebAssembly practical for everyday developers, not just compiler enthusiasts.

Swedish tech scene perspective on edge computing: we have excellent connectivity but also understand the value of local execution for latency-sensitive applications and data sovereignty.
