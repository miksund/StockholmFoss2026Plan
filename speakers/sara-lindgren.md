## About

Security researcher focusing on open source software security, vulnerability research, and secure development practices. Working to make Swedish open source projects more secure through audits, education, and building security culture.

Background in offensive security (penetration testing, vulnerability research) now applied to helping open source projects proactively improve security. Believes security shouldn't be an afterthought and that open source has unique advantages for security when practiced well.

Interested in the intersection of security research and open source: responsible disclosure to projects, contributing security fixes, and building sustainable security practices in community projects.
