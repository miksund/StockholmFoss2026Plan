## About

Independent consultant specializing in Matrix protocol deployments and federated communication systems. Helping Swedish organizations — particularly municipalities, universities, and healthcare providers — adopt Matrix as an alternative to proprietary communication platforms.

With a background in systems integration and enterprise IT, understands the challenges of deploying open source communication tools in organizations that have compliance requirements, legacy systems, and users who expect things to "just work."

Believer in federated, open protocols as essential infrastructure for organizational sovereignty. Practical approach focused on making Matrix work in real-world environments rather than ideological purity.
