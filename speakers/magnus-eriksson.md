## About

Long-time KDE contributor focused on making the Linux desktop accessible and usable for everyone, including users in northern Sweden where connectivity and hardware constraints are real considerations. Core contributor to KDE Plasma with particular focus on accessibility features, input methods, and internationalization.

Believes the Linux desktop is finally ready for mainstream adoption but needs advocates who understand real-world user needs. Works to bridge the gap between developer assumptions and the needs of everyday users, including elderly family members who successfully use Plasma as their daily desktop.

Based in Umeå, brings a perspective from outside the major tech hubs and advocates for considering users with limited bandwidth, older hardware, and varying technical comfort levels.
