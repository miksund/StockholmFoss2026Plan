## About

Senior database administrator and PostgreSQL contributor based in Luleå, northern Sweden. Working with databases for 20 years, with deep expertise in PostgreSQL performance tuning, high availability, and operating databases in challenging environments — including data centers that use natural cooling from Swedish winters.

Contributor to PostgreSQL, primarily in areas of performance monitoring and documentation. Believes PostgreSQL is the best open source database and spends time helping others get the most out of it through consulting, writing, and speaking.

Enjoys the unique perspective of working from northern Sweden, where infrastructure challenges (latency to central Europe, weather impacts on data centers, staffing in remote locations) inform practical approaches to database engineering.
