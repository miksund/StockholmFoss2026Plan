## About

Infrastructure engineer at Mullvad VPN, building and maintaining the systems that power one of the world's most privacy-focused VPN services. Working extensively with NixOS in production, using its declarative, reproducible approach to ensure every server is configured identically and verifiably.

Passionate about privacy technology and the idea that infrastructure itself can be a privacy feature. At Mullvad, the infrastructure is designed so that even operators can't identify individual users — this requires thinking differently about logging, monitoring, and system design.

Strong believer in NixOS for production systems after seeing how it eliminates configuration drift, enables atomic rollbacks, and makes infrastructure truly reproducible. Happy to share both successes and hard-won lessons from running NixOS at scale.
