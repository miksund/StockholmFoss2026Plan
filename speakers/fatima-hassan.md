## About

Community organizer and diversity advocate working to make the Swedish tech industry more inclusive. Co-organizer of Django Girls Stockholm, running free coding workshops for women and non-binary people. Believes representation matters and that the tech industry's homogeneity is both a moral and practical problem.

By day, a software developer navigating the Swedish tech scene as a woman of color. By night (and weekends), organizing events, mentoring newcomers, and working to change the culture of tech communities from the inside.

Focused on practical action rather than just talking about diversity. Organizing workshops that actually teach people to code, creating welcoming spaces in existing communities, and having honest conversations about what inclusive open source looks like.
