## About

Embedded systems engineer at Volvo Cars working on bringing Rust to automotive safety-critical systems. Part of a team exploring how memory-safe languages can improve vehicle software reliability and reduce the kinds of bugs that have traditionally plagued C/C++ codebases.

Passionate about proving that Rust is ready for embedded and safety-critical applications. Working through the challenges of adopting new languages in conservative industries with long certification cycles and existing toolchains.

Background in traditional embedded C development, which gives perspective on both what Rust solves and what challenges it introduces. Believes the embedded world is at an inflection point where memory safety is becoming non-negotiable.
