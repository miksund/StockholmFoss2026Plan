## About

Software developer and climate tech advocate working at the intersection of open source and environmental sustainability. Organizing Stockholm's ClimateAction.tech chapter and building open source tools for climate modeling, carbon tracking, and sustainability analysis.

Believes the tech industry must take responsibility for climate impact — both reducing our own footprint and building tools that help others. Open source is essential for climate tools: the problems are too big for any one company, the data needs to be verifiable, and the solutions need to be accessible to everyone.

Focused on practical tools rather than just awareness. Building and contributing to open source projects that help organizations and individuals understand and reduce their environmental impact.
