## About

Software architect specializing in local-first software and CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types). Building applications that work offline, sync seamlessly, and don't require users to trust centralized servers with their data.

Fascinated by the technical challenges and philosophical implications of local-first software: what does it mean to truly own your data? How do we build collaborative software without centralized infrastructure? These questions drive both technical work and broader thinking about the future of software.

Working on real-world local-first applications while contributing to the ecosystem of libraries and tools that make this approach practical.
