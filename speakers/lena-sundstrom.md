## About

Administrator of mastodon.nu, one of Sweden's largest Mastodon instances, and advocate for the Fediverse as digital public infrastructure. Running a community-focused instance serving thousands of Swedish users since 2017, navigating the challenges of content moderation, sustainability, and building genuine online community.

Background in journalism and media studies, which brings a perspective on social media that goes beyond the technical. Interested in questions of public discourse, platform governance, and what it means to have social media that isn't controlled by advertisers or billionaires.

Not naive about the Fediverse's challenges — moderation is hard, federation brings complexity, and sustainability is an ongoing struggle. But believes the experiment is worth continuing and the lessons are valuable regardless of outcome.
