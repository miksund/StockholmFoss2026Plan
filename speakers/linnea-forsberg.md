## About

Founder and lead organizer of Repair Café Stockholm, a volunteer-run initiative helping people fix broken electronics, appliances, and other household items instead of throwing them away. Passionate about the intersection of environmental sustainability, consumer rights, and open source technology.

Background in electrical engineering with a focus on consumer electronics. Became frustrated with planned obsolescence and the throwaway culture, leading to a career pivot toward repair advocacy and circular economy initiatives.

Increasingly focused on the role open source plays in repairability: open firmware, available schematics, 3D-printable replacement parts, and community-maintained repair guides. Believes the right to repair movement and the open source movement share fundamental values.
