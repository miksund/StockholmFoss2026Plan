## About

Founder and CEO of Polar, a platform enabling open source developers to receive sustainable funding directly from their communities and the companies that depend on their work. Previously founded two developer tools startups and spent years as an open source contributor watching talented maintainers burn out.

Believes the open source sustainability crisis is solvable but requires new economic models that respect how open source actually works. Building Polar to create direct connections between maintainers and the organizations that benefit from their code.

Passionate about the intersection of economics, technology, and community. Thinks a lot about incentive design, market mechanisms, and how to build systems that align individual and collective interests.
