## About

Researcher at Lund University studying the ethical implications of large language models and AI applications. Focus on practical questions: how do we build AI applications responsibly? What does it mean to deploy LLMs in ways that respect users and society?

Not an AI doomer or utopian — a pragmatist trying to help developers and organizations navigate the real challenges of building with AI. Believes technical people need to engage with ethical questions, not outsource them to philosophers or policy makers.

Also deeply involved in the practical side: understanding how tools like LangChain and Ollama work, what local LLMs can and can't do, and how to build AI applications that are transparent about their limitations.
