## About

Software developer who made significant open source contributions during parental leave — not instead of parenting, but during nap times, late nights, and the strange schedule of life with a newborn. Sharing practical advice for others who want to stay connected to open source during career breaks.

Believes parental leave can be an opportunity for different kinds of contribution: documentation, small fixes, async communication. Not advocating for working during leave, but acknowledging that many parents want to maintain skills and connections.

The talk is practical advice, not humble-bragging: how to set realistic expectations, what kinds of contribution work with a newborn's schedule, and how to return to work having grown rather than stagnated.
