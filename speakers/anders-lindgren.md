## About

Professor of Computer Science at Uppsala University, researching how open source contribution can be integrated into computer science education. Pioneering approaches where students learn by contributing to real open source projects rather than just building disposable classroom exercises.

25 years in academia, with growing conviction that traditional CS education misses crucial skills: working in existing codebases, collaborating with strangers, understanding project culture, and navigating real-world software development. Open source contribution teaches these naturally.

Not just theoretical — running courses where students actually contribute to open source projects, with all the messiness that implies. Documenting what works, what fails, and how to structure educational open source contribution.
