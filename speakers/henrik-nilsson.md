## About

Senior researcher at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, focusing on AI infrastructure, large language models, and the concept of "sovereign AI" — the ability to develop and deploy AI systems on national or European infrastructure without dependency on non-European cloud providers.

Leading research projects exploring how open source AI models like Llama and Mistral can be deployed on Swedish supercomputing resources, including work with the Berzelius supercomputer at Linköping University. Interested in the practical challenges of running AI at scale: cost, energy efficiency, data governance, and maintaining European technological independence.

Bridges the gap between academic AI research and practical infrastructure deployment, working with both government agencies and private companies on AI strategy and implementation.
